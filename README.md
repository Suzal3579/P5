#How to use?

         >> Download/Clone the whole repo and run HTML files. Works sWell!
    
	     >> HTML and JAVASCRIPT files have common names to avoid confusion.

         >> To run "TEXTBURST" and some other files your need localhost server. (For eg: XAMPP(APACHE SERVER) in windows would do!)
